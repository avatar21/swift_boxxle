Swift Boxxle
==============

A mostly complete port of GameBoy's Boxxle to Swift. This is my first Swift project that I worked on during the Arkansas Dev Hackathon.
Simply touch in the direction you want to move. For example to move right, touch to the right of the character.
I really tried hard not to use the Virtual D-Pad, per reading many blogs on mobile game design. :)

This port features:

1. 40 levels from the original Boxxle (Game Boy)
2. Touch [next] to go to the next level
3. Touch [reset] to reset the level in case you make a mistake
4. Step counter for each level

This port doesn't include:

1. Level passwords
2. Walking animations (I couldn't find the sprites)
3. A real title screen
